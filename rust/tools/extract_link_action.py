# A "fake" linker command meant to be provided to rustc as `-Clinker={}`. This script will process
# the arguments passed in from rustc and export the objects, version script, and other arguments
# as outputs to later be used by an invocation of `deferred_link_action.py`.
#
# Some arguments here are stripped out e.g. -L<sysroot> in order to save work from having to persist
# an artifact between this action and the deferred link action. See the comments in
# `process_link_args()` for more details.
